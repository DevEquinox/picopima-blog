# Picopima Blog
This is a personal (in the sense that this is done outside of any classes) group exercise to create a blog with the following features:
- User sign up and login with 2FA
- Content manager
- Comments
- Tags
- Search
- User profiles
- Post scheduling

~~Note that this is meant to work with a local MySQL database.~~
Possible change of plans: we are considering using GCP.

# Warning
*In theory*, to run the project you must run the backend and the frontend. However, we aren't working off a database yet.
